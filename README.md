# SimpleCustomerInvoice
The simple customer invoice is an interactive application used to assist with customer purchases. The user is required to enter information about the product being sold and the customer and then print that information based on what the user enters. It then asks the user if they want to print the purchase report which consists of the product price, tax, commission, discount, and the total.
